      <h1>Welcome to Dad League</h1>
      <p>
        Dad League is an iRacing league built for busy dads (or moms!) who still want to enjoy wheel-to-wheel racing — after the kids are asleep and the chaos of the day has settled. Whether you're surviving a newborn or managing toddlers, we get it: time is precious, and practice laps are a luxury.
      </p>

    <button class="cta" onclick="sendEmail()" aria-label="Request an invite to Dad League">
      Request an Invite
    </button>

    <p>
      We race two to three nights a week, always in the late evening hours to respect bedtime routines, dinner cleanup, and "just one more story." The vibe is low-pressure, high-respect and low commitment.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're looking for a league that values family-first schedules, clean racing, and camaraderie over competition, Dad League might be the perfect fit. All skill levels welcome, as long as you bring a positive attitude and understand that someone might have to hop off mid-race for a diaper emergency.
    </p>
